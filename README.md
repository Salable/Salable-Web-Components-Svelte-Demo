# Salable Web Components : Svelte Demo

[Salable](https://www.salable.app) is a subscription licensing platform that allows users to have more control over their customers and how they interact with and use your applications/products.

This demo repository shows how you can implement Salable Web Components into a Svelte project to do things such as:

- Show pricing tables to allow users to subscribe to plans and create licenses
- Show/Download all of the invoices associated with a subscription
- Allow users to subscribe to a plan via an in-line checkout
